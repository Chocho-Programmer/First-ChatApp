        <h2 className='text-2xl ml-5 text-[#02c8db] font-semibold underline'>Terms of Services</h2>
        <p className='mx-5 text-blue-900'><div className='mx-5 text-[18px] text-slate-800 font-semibold mt-2'>Provide a personalised experience for you:</div>
        Your experience on ChatApp is unlike anyone else's: from the Posts, Stories, events, ads and other content that you see in ChatApp News Feed or our video platform to the ChatApp Pages that you follow and other features you might use, such as ChatApp Marketplace and search. For example, we use data about the connections you make, the choices and settings you select, and what you share and do on and off our Products to personalise your experience.
        <div className='mx-5 text-[18px] text-slate-800 font-semibold mt-2'>Connect you with people and organisations that you care about:</div>
        We help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organisations and others that matter to you across the ChatApp Products you use. We use data to make suggestions for you and others – for example, groups to join, events to attend, ChatApp Pages to follow or send a message to, shows to watch and people you may want to become friends with. Stronger ties make for better communities, and we believe that our services are most useful when people are connected to people, groups and organisations that they care about.
        <div className='mx-5 text-[18px] text-slate-800 font-semibold mt-2'>Empower you to express yourself and communicate about what matters to you:</div>
        There are many ways to express yourself on ChatApp to communicate with friends, family and others about what matters to you – for example, sharing status updates, photos, videos and stories across the ChatApp Products (consistent with your settings), sending messages or making voice or video calls to a friend or several people, creating events or groups, or adding content to your profile, as well as showing you insights on how others engage with your content. We have also developed, and continue to explore, new ways for people to use technology, such as augmented reality and 360 video to create and share more expressive and engaging content on ChatApp Products.
        Help you discover content, products and services that may interest you:
        We show you personalised ads, offers and other sponsored or commercial content to help you discover content, products and services that are offered by the many businesses and organisations that use ChatApp and other ChatApp Products. Section 2 below explains this in more detail.
        <div className='mx-5 text-[18px] text-slate-800 font-semibold mt-2'>Promote the safety, security and integrity of our services, combat harmful conduct and keep our community of users safe:</div>
        People will only build community on ChatApp Products if they feel safe and secure. We work hard to maintain the security (including the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality) of our Products and services. We employ dedicated teams around the world, work with external service providers, partners and other relevant entities and develop advanced technical systems to detect potential misuse of our Products, harmful conduct towards others and situations where we may be able to help support or protect our community, including to respond to user reports of potentially violating content. If we learn of content or conduct such as this, we may take appropriate action based on our assessment that may include notifying you, offering help, removing content, removing or restricting access to certain features, disabling an account or contacting law enforcement. We share data across ChatApp Companies when we detect misuse or harmful conduct by someone using one of our Products or to help keep ChatApp Products, users and the community safe. For example, we share information with ChatApp Companies that provide financial products and services to help them promote safety, security and integrity and comply with applicable law. ChatApp may access, preserve, use and share any information it collects about you where it has a good faith belief that it is required or permitted by law to do so.

        <h2 className='text-2xl ml-5 text-[#02c8db] font-semibold underline'>Policy </h2>
        <p className='mx-5 text-blue-900'>ChatApp builds technologies and services that enable people to connect with each other, build communities and grow businesses. These Terms govern your use of ChatApp,  and the other products, features, apps, services, technologies and software that we offer (the ChatApp Products or Products), except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply. These Products are provided to you by ChatApp Platforms, Inc.

        We don't charge you to use ChatApp or the other products and services covered by these Terms, unless we state otherwise. Instead, businesses, organisations and other persons pay us to show you ads for their products and services. By using our Products, you agree that we can show you ads that we think may be relevant to you and your interests. We use your personal data to help determine which personalised ads to show you.

        We don't sell your personal data to advertisers, and we don't share information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email address or other contact information) with advertisers unless you give us specific permission. Instead, advertisers can tell us things such as the kind of audience that they want to see their ads, and we show those ads to people who may be interested. We provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads that help them understand how people are interacting with their content. See Section 2 below to learn more about how personalised advertising under these Terms works on the ChatApp Products.

        Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use your personal data to determine some of the ads that you see and provide all of the other services described below. You can also go to your settings pages of the relevant ChatApp Product at any time to review the privacy choices that you have about how we use your data.
